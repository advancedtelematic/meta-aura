meta-aura
=========

This layer simply provides support for building pianobar, a console-based
pandora client.



Dependencies
------------

Poky
  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
  branch: denzil or later
  revision: HEAD



Building
--------

meta-aura doesn't provide any reference images, as its sole purpose is to
provide pianobar without any additional dependencies. The most straightforward
way of trying out the layer is by adding it to a preexisting build.

Begin by adding the layer to bblayers. For example:
    BBLAYERS ?= " \
        /home/strassek/poky/meta \
        /home/strassek/poky/meta-yocto \
        /home/strassek/poky/meta-aura \

Assuming your image inherits from core-image you can add pianobar to local.conf like so:
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL = "pianobar"

By default, bitbake will pull the latest version of pianobar available from 
github. To increase the likelyhood that things just work, you may want to 
specify an actual release version like so:
    PREFERRED_VERSION_pianobar = "20120907"

At this point you should be ready to build the image.
